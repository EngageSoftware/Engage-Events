    <ul>
        <li>
            Added categories

    <h3>Known Issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Some versions of modules from OnyakTech will conflict with Engage: Events.  Starting in DNN 5.2, the Telerik assembly is shared with the core, so this issue should be resolved.</li>
        <li>In DNN 5.2, the reference to the included Telerik assembly is incompatible with any other version.  It is recommended to upgrade to DNN 5.2.2 or above to address this issue.</li>
        <li>The entire range of a recurring event might not display on the Calendar view.&nbsp; To increase performance, only 1,000 possible dates are considered to display.&nbsp; This means that only about 33 years of a yearly recurrence will display, while close to the full 1,000 days of a daily recurrence will be shown.</li>
        <li>If you have multiple events modules on the same page, paging through the events or responses lists on one module will cause the other module to change pages as well.&nbsp; This can cause an issue if the other module has fewer pages than the module you are paging through, resulting in a blank module.</li>
        <li>Line breaks entered in the Overview field of an event are not displayed; that is, all text displays on the same line, regardless of any line breaks entered.</li>
    </ul>
