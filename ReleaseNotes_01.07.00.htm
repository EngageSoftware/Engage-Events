    <h3>Known Issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The entire range of a recurring event might not display on the Calendar view. To increase performance, only 1,000 possible dates are considered to display. This means that only about 33 years of a yearly recurrence will display, while close to the full 1,000 days of a daily recurrence will be shown.</li>
    </ul>
