	<h3>Change Log</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug preventing install on DNN 5.1</li>
        <li>More details can be found on the <a href="http://support.engagemodules.com/Project/Project.aspx?Tab=Changelog&amp;PROJID=3">Engage: Events Change Log</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Known Issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Some versions of modules from OnyakTech will conflict with Engage: Events.</li>
        <li>The entire range of a recurring event might not display on the Calendar view.&nbsp; To increase performance, only 1,000 possible dates are considered to display.&nbsp; This means that only about 33 years of a yearly recurrence will display, while close to the full 1,000 days of a daily recurrence will be shown.</li>
        <li>If you have multiple events modules on the same page, paging through the events or responses lists on one module will cause the other module to change pages as well.&nbsp; This can cause an issue if the other module has fewer pages than the module you are paging through, resulting in a blank module.</li>
        <li>Line breaks entered in the Overview field of an event are not displayed; that is, all text displays on the same line, regardless of any line breaks entered.</li>
    </ul>
