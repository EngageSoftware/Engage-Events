		<h3>Change Log</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Created three templates (MiniList, Narrow, and ListingShort) for use in narrow panes</li>
    <li>Added a setting to the module to allow ReadMore links to navigate to a different instance of the module</li>
    <li>Updated the Engage:ReadMore template token to allow child content.&nbsp; This enables scenarios where other tokens in the template can be wrapped in a link to the event details</li>

    <li>Updated the Engage:ReadMore template token to link to the details page if it is used in a Header or Footer template</li>
    <li>Created a new Engage:Duration template token to display "smart" timespan values, such as are used in the Responses listing.</li>
    <li>Updated the registration process to use a modal popup, keeping the user in their current context</li>
    <li>Added the ability to limit the number of "Attending" registrations for an event, giving the option to display a custom message for each event once it is full</li>
    <li>Added Export to CSV and Excel from the registration details page, to get a list of all responses to an event</li>
    <li>The method for indicating that an event takes place during Daylight Time has been changed to use an explicit checkbox , rather than manually adjusting the time zone.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug where you could get stuck with an invalid end date when creating an event</li>
    <li>Fixed some bugs with the rendering of the default listing template in IE6</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with the rendering of the default listing template in IE7</li>
    <li>More details can be found on the <a href="http://support.engagemodules.com/Project/Project.aspx?Tab=Changelog&amp;PROJID=3">Engage: Events Change Log</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>

    <li><span class="Normal">Engage: Events 1.1 is incompatible with Engage: Dashboard 1.0.&nbsp; Please upgrade to Engage: Dashboard 1.0.1 after installing Engage: Events 1.1.</span></li>
    <li>Some versions of modules from OnyakTech will conflict with Engage: Events.</li>
    <li>The entire range of a recurring event might not display on the Calendar view.&nbsp; To increase performance, only 1,000 possible dates are considered to display.&nbsp; This means that only about 33 years of a yearly recurrence will display, while close to the full 1,000 days of a daily recurrence will be shown.</li>
    <li>If you have multiple events modules on the same page, paging through the events or responses lists on one module will cause the other module to change pages as well.&nbsp; This can cause an issue if the other module has fewer pages than the module you are paging through, resulting in a blank module.</li>

    <li>Line breaks entered in the Overview field of an event are not displayed; that is, all text displays on the same line, regardless of any line breaks entered.</li>
</ul>
